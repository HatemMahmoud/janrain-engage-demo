This is a Rails app that demonstrates the basic usage of the rpx_now gem (http://github.com/grosser/rpx_now)
which allows you to easily add Janrain Engage (formerly RPX) to your Rails app.

Janrain Engage allows your visitors to sign-in to your site with their existing accounts on Facebook,
Google, Twitter, Yahoo!, LinkedIn, Windows Live, MySpace, AOL or other networks and then gather their profile data 
and publish their activities from your site to multiple social networks.

Try it
------
1. git clone git@github.com:hatem/janrain-engage-demo.git
2. cd janrain-engage-demo
3. Install required gems: rake gems:install
4. Run the app and try the login widget

Use it
------
1. Login to janrain.com and create a new application
2. Replace RPXNow.api_key in /config/environment.rb with the API Key of your new application 
3. In the "Sign-in" section of your Janrain dashboard, you can choose the providers you want to be included in the widget. A wizard will guide you if a provider needs some configuration.
Note: a Facebook application needs "Connect URL" which looks like this: https://janrain-engage-demo.rpxnow.com/
